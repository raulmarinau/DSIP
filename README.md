This project is my attempt at providing a solution for [Kaggle's Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) challenge following some of the top notebooks as guidelines.
Contains an exploratory jupyter notebook (fraud.ipynb) and the final solution (submission.ipynb) using CatBoost which proved best during exploration.
